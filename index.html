						"Abstract: Deep-learning models have become pervasive tools in science and engineering. However, their energy requirements now increasingly limit their scalability. Deep-learning accelerators aim to perform deep learning energy-efficiently, usually targeting the inference phase and often by exploiting physical substrates beyond conventional electronics. Approaches so far have been unable to apply the backpropagation algorithm to train unconventional novel hardware in situ. The advantages of backpropagation have made it the de facto training method for large-scale neural networks, so this deficiency constitutes a major impediment. Here we introduce a hybrid in situ–in silico algorithm, called physics-aware training, that applies backpropagation to train controllable physical systems. Just as deep learning realizes computations with deep neural networks made from layers of mathematical functions, our approach allows us to train deep physical neural networks made from layers of controllable physical systems, even when the physical layers lack any mathematical isomorphism to conventional artificial neural network layers. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, we train diverse physical neural networks based on optics, mechanics and electronics to experimentally perform audio and image classification tasks. Physics-aware training combines the scalability of backpropagation with the automatic mitigation of imperfections and noise achievable with in situ algorithms. Physical neural networks have the potential to perform machine learning faster and more energy-efficiently than conventional electronic processors and, more broadly, can endow physical systems with automatically designed physical functionalities, for example, for robotics, materials and smart sensors."

						"Abstract: In continuation with our ongoing research and analysis of various actuation and control strategies for robotic prosthesis, this is the second iteration appends the talk on current state of robotic prosthetics and soft robotics. Our discussion begins with understanding prosthetics and the scope of this term followed by a discussion into neuroprosthetics. Nervous tissue typically has a very low potential for intrinsic regeneration with the primary reason being that the connections between neurons is as important for the function as the gross number of neuron in the tissue. A lot of cases of physical disability are associated with damage to nervous tissue. A way to interact with these neurons has the potential to restore function in a disabled limb. On the other hand, a means of interaction with nervous tissue can also carve a way for development of advanced brain controlled prosthetics together with potential to associate a mechanical prosthetic limb as a contributor to the cognitive sensory bank by restoring sensations such as touch, pressure, temperature etc. in a limb that’s been replaced with a mechanical prosthesis. In this talk we discuss the various control strategies for robotic prostheses along with looking at some inspiring examples of neuroprosthetics based control and sensory rehabilitation in limb amputation cases. A short discussion on cognitive rehabilitation options associated with limb loss is also included."
